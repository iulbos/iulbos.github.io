        <h1 class="font-bold">The best operating system ever!</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">iuselinuxbtwOS</span> is not just an operating system.
          It is a <strong>choice</strong>. A lifestyle. A gentle but persistent
          reminder that you made better decisions than most people.
        </p>

        <p>
          While others wait for updates, <span class="emphasis"
            >we build them</span
          >. While others reboot in fear, we reboot in triumph. While others ask
          “does it support my hardware?”, iuselinuxbtwOS asks whether your
          hardware deserves it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This OS does not hold your hand. It hands you <span class="emphasis"
            >power</span
          > — then quietly watches to see if you are worthy.
        </p>

        <blockquote>I use Linux, by the way.</blockquote>

        <p>
          Every terminal opened is an act of freedom. Every config file edited
          is a declaration of independence. Every successful boot confirms that
          nothing happened unless
          <em>you explicitly allowed it</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          iuselinuxbtwOS rejects unnecessary clicks, bloated defaults, and the
          tyranny of “user-friendly” lies. Here, you are the user, the
          administrator, and occasionally the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          It boots fast.<br />
          It breaks sometimes.<br />
          And when it does, <span class="emphasis">you learn something</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          No telemetry.<br />
          No compromises.<br />
          No corporate babysitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only you, your machine, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing that
          control was never taken from you — because you never gave it away.
        </p>

        <p>
          iuselinuxbtwOS is not for everyone. And that is precisely why it is
          better.

        <h2>Okay, let's get to the point.</h2>
        <p>
          We are trying to make a Linux-based operating system which fixes most
          issues plauging it now. Stuff like not making disk encryption easily
          controlled, security features disabled by default etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          We are still developing it, and the project may not go anywhere, if
          you want to try it, you can download it below.

          The builds are made with <a href="https://blue-build.org/"
            >Blue-Build</a
